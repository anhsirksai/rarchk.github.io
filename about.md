Hi, folks!!

My name is Ronak Kogta, and I'm on verge of finishing my masters from IIIT Hyderabad, hence  I'm currently looking for **interesting job oppertunites**, which eventually drives me towards *linux kernel development* and *high performance computing*. If you happen to know some, then please do *[mail]({{ site.owner.email }})* me. 

My interest lies in *parallel algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems.* In my free time, I try to grasp mathematics. For quite a time, I'm interested in analyzaing *dyanmical systems*, and Smale's Horse Shoe map to demonstrate chaos really make me tinkle.  

Here are my other things, that I spend time on:

+ **[Research@IIIT-H](http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~ronak.kogta/)**
+ **[My Projects]({{site.url}}/projects)**

P.S : I love this way of vim based, git powered [blogging]({{site.url}}), and that's why I've decided to leave blogger for good.
